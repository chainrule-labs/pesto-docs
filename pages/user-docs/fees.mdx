# Fees

## How much do I have to pay in fees?

Users only pay fees when increasing their position or when adding leverage to their position.

When increasing a position, the maximum fee that users will pay is 0.3% of the collateral amount supplied in that transaction.

When adding leverage to a position, the maximum fee that users will pay is 0.3% of the amount borrowed in that transaction.

Users interacting with the shAave protocol through a client may get discounts, as [client operators](/references/glossary/mdx) earn a share of the protocol fees and may offer incentives by forgoing some of their earnings in favor of their users.

**Example:** If the current client rate is 30%, this means that a client can earn 30% of the maximum fee. However, a client can opt to only keep 90% of those earnings by setting their take rate to 90%. The remaining 10% of that client's earnings is applied as a discount to the total fees their users are required to pay. This would mean that:

-   Users of that client pay a fee of 0.291% instead of 0.3%.
-   The 0.291% fee collected is distributed as follows:
    -   The utilized client keeps 0.081%.
    -   The protocol keeps 0.21%.

These fees are expressed as a percentage of the collateral amount supplied when increasing a position or the amount borrowed when adding leverage to a position.

For a detailed breakdown of how fees are calculated, refer to the [Technical Docs](/technical-docs/fees).

## Are fees collected when adding collateral to a position to increase its health factor on Aave?

No. There are only two functions on the `Position` smart contract that collect fees: [`add`](/technical-docs/contracts/position.md#add), which increases the position, and [`addLeverage`](..//technical-docs/contracts/position.md#addleverage), which adds leverage to the position using the base token balance.
