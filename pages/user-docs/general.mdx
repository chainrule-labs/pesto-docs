# General

## Is the core protocol immutable?

Yes. The [core shAave smart contracts](/technical-docs/contracts) are immutable.

## What aspects of the protocol are governed by the shAave DAO?

The core shAave protocol is immutable, but the DAO can govern [periphery functionality](/technical-docs/contracts) such as the protocol fees.

## How does shAave incentivize decentralized frontends?

There is a small [protocol fee](/user-docs/fees) charged when users increase a position's size and when they add leverage to a position. A portion of this fee goes to the protocol and another portion is allocated to frontend operators.

Frontend operators can also choose to offer users of their frontend a discount on the protocol fee, which incentivizes users to use their frontend.

This feature was inspired by the [Liquity Protocol](https://www.liquity.org/frontend).

## Why long with shAave, why not just hold long token?

Suppose a user only has 1 WETH, and 1 WETH = 1000 USDC at $t_1$, and 1 WETH = 1500 USDC at $t_2$.

If the user just holds 1 WETH, the net gains will be 500 USDC.

If the user creates a position on shAave to long WETH, the following can be done automatically:

1. Supply 1 WETH as collateral
2. Borrow 900 USDC
3. Swap 900 USDC for 0.9 WETH

Now, the user is exposed to the potential gains or losses of 1.9 WETH, which means that, at $t_2$, 1.9 WETH = 2850 USDC.

If the user closes the position at $t_2$, the profit is 1350 USDC - interest - fees.
