# Contracts

The shAave protocol consists of three primary smart contracts: two core and one periphery.

## Core

### PositionFactory

The `PositionFactory` contract is responsible for creating `Position` contracts.

### Position

The `Position` contract represents one position of an individual user. A single user can own multiple `Position` contracts, each representing a different combination of collateral, debt, and base tokens.

`Position` contracts are deployed by the `PositionFactory` contract via the `createPosition` function.

## Periphery

### FeeCollector

The `FeeCollector` contract is responsible for collecting and allocating protocol fees.
