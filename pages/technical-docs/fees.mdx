# Fees

Protocol fees are collected when [`add`](/technical-docs/contracts/position.mdx#add) and [`addLeverage`](/technical-docs/contracts/position.mdx#addleverage) are called on a `Position` contract.

## How are fees calculated when `add` is called?

When [`add`](/technical-docs/contracts/position.mdx#add) is called on a `Position` contract, a small amount of the [collateral token](/references/glossary.mdx) supplied is taken as a fee.

| Quantity          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| $cAmt$            | The amount of collateral token supplied when calling `add`.                                                                                                                                                    |
| $protocolFeeRate$ | The maximum fee the user could pay, as a percentage of $cAmt$. <br/><br/> To get the current fee rate, call [protocol fee rate](contracts/fee-collector.mdx#protocol_fee_rate) on the `FeeCollector` contract. |
| $maxFee$          | The maximum fee the user could pay, in terms of the position's collateral token. <br/><br/> $=cAmt*protocolFeeRate$                                                                                            |
| $clientRate$      | The [percentage](contracts/fee-collector.mdx#clientrate) of $maxFee$ that clients can keep.                                                                                                                    |
| $clientTakeRate$  | The [percentage](contracts/fee-collector.mdx#clienttakerates) of $clientRate$ that the utilized client keeps.                                                                                                  |
| $clientFee$       | The amount the utilized client keeps in terms of the position's collateral token. <br/><br/> $=maxFee*clientRate*clientTakeRate$                                                                               |
| $protocolFee$     | The amount the protocol keeps. <br/><br/> $=maxFee*(100\%-clientRate)$                                                                                                                                         |
| $userSavings$     | The amount that users of the utilized client save. <br/><br/> $=maxFee*(100\%-clientTakeRate)*clientRate$                                                                                                      |

The following is an example calculation for a transaction where a user calls `add` using a client that has set their take rate to 90%, the current client rate is 30%, and the protocol fee rate is 0.3%.

$$cAmt=\$1000$$

$$protocolFeeRate=0.3\%$$

$$clientRate=30\%$$

$$clientTakeRate=90\%$$

$$maxFee=\$1000*0.3\%=\$3$$

$$clientFee=\$3*30\%*90\%=\$0.81$$

$$protocolFee=\$3*70\%=\$2.10$$

$$userSavings=\$3*10\%*30\%=\$0.09$$

$\therefore$ Instead of paying the maximum fee of \$3.00, the user only paid \$2.91.

## How are fees calculated when `addLeverage` is called?

When [`addLeverage`](/technical-docs/contracts/position.mdx#addleverage) is called on a `Position` contract, its [base token](/references/glossary.mdx) is used to borrow more [debt token](/references/glossary.mdx). A small amount of the debt token borrowed is taken as a fee.

| $cTotal$          | The total amount of collateral backing the position's loan on Aave (collaterall token + base token). <br/><br/> Obtained by calling `getUserAccountData` on [Aave's Pool contract](https://docs.aave.com/developers/core-contracts/pool#getuseraccountdata). |
| $dTotal$          | The total amount of debt the position has on Aave. <br/><br/> Obtained by calling `getUserAccountData` on [Aave's Pool contract](https://docs.aave.com/developers/core-contracts/pool#getuseraccountdata).                                                   |
| $LTV$             | The maximum loan-to-value ratio the position can have, given all of its current collateral on Aave. <br/><br/> Obtained by calling `getUserAccountData` on [Aave's Pool contract](https://docs.aave.com/developers/core-contracts/pool#getuseraccountdata).  |
| $dAmt$            | The amount of debt token borrowed when calling `addLeverage`. <br/><br/> $dAmt_{max}=cTotal*LTV-dTotal$ <br/><br/> To minimize the risk of liquidation, $dAmt$ should be less than $dAmt_{max}$.                                                             |

The following is an example calculation for a transaction where a user calls `addLeverage` using a client that has set their take rate to 90%, the current client rate is 30%, and the protocol fee rate is 0.3%.

$$cTotal=\$5000$$

$$dTotal=\$2500$$

$$LTV=80\%$$

$$dAmt_{max}=\$5000*80\%-\$2500=\$1500$$

$$dAmt=\$1000$$

$$protocolFeeRate=0.3\%$$

$$clientRate=30\%$$

$$clientTakeRate=90\%$$

$$maxFee=\$1000*0.3\%=\$3$$

$$clientFee=\$3*30\%*90\%=\$0.81$$

$$protocolFee=\$3*70\%=\$2.10$$

$$userSavings=\$3*10\%*30\%=\$0.09$$

$\therefore$ Instead of paying the maximum fee of \$3.00, the user only paid \$2.91.
