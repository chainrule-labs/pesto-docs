| Collateral Token    | The token that a `Position` contract supplies as collateral to Aave when increasing the size of the position. <br/><br/> [C_TOKEN](technical-docs/contracts/position#c_token)                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Debt Token          | The token that the `Position` contract borrows from Aave. This is also known as the "short token". <br/><br/> [D_TOKEN](technical-docs/contracts/position#d_token)                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Base Token          | The token that the `Position` contract swaps D_TOKEN for through Uniswap. This is also known as the "long token". <br/><br/> After this token is obtained from Uniswap, the `Position` contract automatically supplies it to Aave as collateral to improve its health factor. <br/><br/> [B_TOKEN](technical-docs/contracts/position#b_token) |
| aToken              | The token that represents the value of the collateral + interest for a particular token supplied to Aave as collateral. <br/><br/> This token is given to the `Position` contract when collateral is supplied. <br/><br/> Refer to [Aave's docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/tokens/atoken) for more info.                               |
| Variable Debt Token | The token that represents the value of the debt + interest for a particular token borrowed from Aave. <br/><br/> This token is given to the `Position` contract when D_TOKEN is borrowed. <br/><br/> Refer to [Aave's docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/tokens/debttoken) for more info.                                                 |

| Client Operator     | The account of the entity that runs a client to facilitate usage of the shAave protocol. <br/><br/> Fees earned by this operator's client are allocated to this account on the [`FeeCollector`](/technical-docs/contracts/fee-collector.mdx) contract.                                                                                        |
